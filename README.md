## Hi there 👋

Hi, I am Jérôme Coupé a front-end developer with a strong background in design and UX from Brussels, Belgium. I help clients and agencies bridge the gap between design and development. When not freelancing, I also teach design and front-end design and development at IAD.

If you need to get a hold of me, I will be blogging on [Webstoemp](https://www.webstoemp.com), ranting on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jeromecoupe) or drinking a craft beer in downtown Brussels.
