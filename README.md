Hi, I am Jérôme Coupé a front-end developer with a background in design and UX from Brussels, Belgium. I help clients and agencies bridge the gap between design and development. When not freelancing, I teach design and front-end development at IAD.

I am out and about a lot. If you need to get a hold of me, [webstoemp](https://www.webstoemp.com) is your best bet.
